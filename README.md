# Box-Cox transformed KDE for speckle PDF and gCNR estimation
 This MATLAB code is published to accompany the article "Robust non-parametric estimation of speckle probability densities and gCNR" (IEEE Open Journal of UFFC, In press, DOI: 10.1109/OJUFFC.2024.3445868). 

 Examples are included, and the code is plug-and-play (without known dependencies). If you experience any problems or want to suggest changes, contact: havard.arnestad@gmail.com

 Planned(!) and possible(?) updates:
 - (!) Update readme once the article is out (DOI, more explanations, etc.)
 - (?) Include a test of normality to flag cases where performance may drop.
 - (?) Make a Python implementation.
