# Box-Cox transformed KDE for speckle PDF and gCNR estimation
 This MATLAB code is published to accompany the article "Robust non-parametric estimation of speckle probability densities and gCNR" (UNDER REVIEW, DOI: TBA). 

 Examples are included, and the code is plug-and-play. If you experience any problems, contact: havard.arnestad@gmail.com

 Planned updates:
 - Include a test of normality to flag cases where performance may drop
 - Update code and examples (style and readability)
